      <title>R&amp;D applications in quantitative finance, trading and financial markets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We tackled a ​portfolio compression problem, which consisted of: given a fixed set of deals with a specific sensitivity (delta) value, to find the smallest basket of deals with the same delta from a big pool of internal live trades. The external version of this problem (trades agreed between a network of banks) was solved using a vendor solution (TriOptima). Under our own initiative we modeled this problem and it turned out that it resembles the ​subset-sum problem family, which is known to be NP-complete. We applied a tailored optimization method found in the computational finance literature to get an approximate solution&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with ​Prof. Arturo Hernandez and Prof. John McCall in black-box optimization methods. I analyzed population based algorithms that employ probabilistic models to guide the search process and that are built upon the Information
Geometry (IG) framework. Our goal was to introduce a novel global optimization algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Research in Metaheuristic Optimization and Particle Filtering methods; applications in computational chemistry and computer vision</title>
      <link>https://mjaenm.github.io/research/particlefiltering/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my honors thesis I studied the main principles behind evolutionary algorithms and in particular, metaheuristics such as Particle Swarm Optimization. The purpose of this research was to develop hybrid approaches together with the particle filter method (PF) applied to the video object tracking problem&lt;/p&gt;

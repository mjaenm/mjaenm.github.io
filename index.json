The goal was to tackle the chemical equation balancing problem by using exact and metaheuristic methods. I contributed by implementing algebraic methods based on matrix computations and metaheuristics using object-oriented-programming in Java. We collected a dataset for testing this problem and presented the experimental results in a local conference on optimization and software.\nResearch outputs  Talk at Congreso Internacional de Computo en Optimizacion y Software (CICos 2014).
